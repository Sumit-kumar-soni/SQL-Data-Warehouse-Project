📊 **Data Layers in a Modern Data Architecture**

This project explores the **three-tiered data architecture** commonly used in data engineering and analytics pipelines: **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**.

---

🪙 **Bronze Layer – Raw Data**

* **Definition:** Ingested raw data directly from source systems.
* **Purpose:** Traceability, debugging, and auditing.
* **Processing:** No transformation — data is loaded *as-is*.
* **Audience:** Data Engineers.

---

🥈 **Silver Layer – Cleaned Data**

* **Definition:** Standardized and cleansed data.
* **Purpose:** Prepares data for analysis.
* **Processing:**

  * Data cleaning
  * Normalization
  * Enrichment
  * Intermediate transformations
* **Audience:** Data Analysts and Engineers.

---

🥇 **Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data**

* **Definition:** Aggregated and modeled data for business users.
* **Purpose:** Reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.
* **Processing:**

  * Business logic application
  * Star schema design
  * Aggregated views
* **Audience:** Business users, Analysts, Engineers.

---

🧩 **Key Processes Across Layers**

* **Data Ingestion & Validation**
* **Exploration, Cleansing, and Documentation**
* **Integration, Modeling, and Version Control (Git)**

---

🏗️ **Technical Considerations:**

* Source system interviews for context
* Data storage technologies (SQL Server, Oracle, AWS, etc.)
* Integration methods (APIs, Kafka, files, DB connectors)
* Load strategies (Full vs. Incremental)
* Security (Tokens, VPNs, Whitelisting)
